# HousePrice_Prediction

Certainly! House price prediction is a common machine learning task where the goal is to predict the price of a house based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc.

House price prediction involves building a machine learning model to estimate the price of a house based on various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, etc. Below is a high-level description of the steps involved in creating a house price prediction model using Python.

#This code performs the following steps:

Load the dataset: Reads the dataset, assuming it's in a CSV format. Adjust the filename accordingly.

Split the dataset: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Create and train a linear regression model: Uses scikit-learn's LinearRegression to create a linear regression model and trains it on the training data.

Make predictions: Predictions are made on the testing data using the trained model.

Evaluate the model: The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared are calculated to evaluate the performance of the model.

Visualize predictions vs. actual prices: A scatter plot is created to visualize how well the predicted prices align with the actual prices.

Example prediction for a new house: Demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict the price for a new house with given features.

Make sure to replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the actual filename of your dataset and adjust the feature columns accordingly. Additionally, consider preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features based on the nature of your dataset.
